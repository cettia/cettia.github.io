        <p>Cettia is a new web framework to write real-time web application and service based on its own polyglot protocol built over transport such as HTTP and WebSocket. <sup><strong>A</strong></sup> Cettia focuses on providing reliable full duplex connection and making the best use of it for modern enterprise application development so that teams can focus on event handling without unnecessary ties to low-level details like transport mechanisms and message loss and integrate application with any technologies or patterns for enterprise application with ease. <sup><strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong></sup></p>
