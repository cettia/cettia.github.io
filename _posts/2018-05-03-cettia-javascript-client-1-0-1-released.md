Cettia JavaScript Client 1.0.1 has been released. This release contains a bug-fix for the reconnection [#23](https://github.com/cettia/cettia-javascript-client/issues/23).

By the way, we've been busy writing a introductory tutorial to Cettia, [Building real-time web applications with Cettia](/guides/cettia-tutorial/), in the meantime. It walks you through the reason behind key design decisions that Cettia team have made in the Cettia as well as various patterns and features required to build real-time oriented application without compromise with Cettia.

Please check it out if you are interested!
