It is my pleasure to announce the first release candidate of [Asity 2.0.0](http://asity.cettia.io). Below are notable changes in this release.

- Delegate thread management to underlying I/O framework [#26](https://github.com/cettia/asity/issues/26)
- Grizzly should read request body by chunk asynchronously [#25](https://github.com/cettia/asity/issues/25)
- Make sure Servlet 3 bridge is compatible with Servlet 4 - it's confirmed with Undertow 2 [#21](https://github.com/cettia/asity/issues/21)

Visit [2.0.0-RC1 milestone](https://github.com/cettia/asity/milestone/5?closed=1) for the complete list of the changes. Unless there's anything else, Asity 2.0.0 GA release will ship in the next two or three weeks with various working examples. If you run into any issues, let us know through [Cettia Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/cettia).
