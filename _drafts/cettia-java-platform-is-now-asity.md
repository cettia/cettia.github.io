Cettia Java Platform is now called Asity, which is created to run Cettia applications written in Java on any platform on top of the Java Virtual Machine.

> Asity is a lightweight abstraction layer for I/O frameworks which is designed to build applications that can run on any full-stack framework, any micro framework or any raw server on the JVM.
